# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using machine learning techniques. The dataset was tested with two classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The results indicate that Naive Bayes achieved a higher accuracy rate of 0.83, while Decision Tree had an accuracy of 0.70. The training dataset used in this project consists of nearly 700 data points.

## Problem Statement

The primary challenge addressed in this project is to develop a robust model for predicting loan eligibility. The model needs to accurately assess whether an applicant is eligible for a loan based on various features present in the dataset.
## Goal of this Project

The goal of this project is to create an effective machine learning model that can predict loan eligibility with high accuracy. This involves exploring different algorithms, optimizing model performance, and providing insights into the factors influencing loan approval.

## Dataset

The training dataset comprises nearly 700 data points, each with features relevant to loan eligibility.

## Hypothesis Generation

Before diving into data analysis, several hypotheses were generated regarding the factors influencing loan eligibility. These hypotheses serve as a foundation for exploring and understanding the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains information like Loan_ID, Gender,	Married	Dependents,	Education,	Self_Employed,	ApplicantIncome,	CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount,	Loan_Amount_Term,	Credit_History,	Property_Area.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the dataset. This involved visualizations and statistical analyses to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and detect outliers.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing steps were implemented to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features. These steps ensure that the dataset is ready for training machine learning models.

## Model Building

Two machine learning algorithms, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes, were tested on the dataset. The performance of each model was evaluated based on accuracy metrics to determine their effectiveness in predicting loan eligibility.
