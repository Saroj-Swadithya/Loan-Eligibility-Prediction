# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This project focuses on predicting loan eligibility using machine learning techniques. The dataset was tested with two classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The results indicate that Naive Bayes achieved a higher accuracy rate of 0.83, while Decision Tree had an accuracy of 0.70. The training dataset used in this project consists of nearly 700 data points.
